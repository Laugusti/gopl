Develop startElement and endElement into a general HTML pretty-printer. Print comment nodes, text nodes, and the attributes of each element (<a href='...'>). Use short forms like <img/> instead of <img></img> when an element has no children. Write a test to ensure that the output can be parsed sucessfully. (See Chapter 11.)
